Merge script for CandyRoms

 The source directory; this is automatically three folders up because the script
 is located in vendor/candy/scripts. Other ROMs will need to change this. The logic is
 as follows:

 1. Get the absolute path of the script with os.path.realpath in case there is a symlink
    This script may be symlinked by a manifest so we need to account for that
 2. Get the folder containing the script with dirname
 3. Move into the folder that is three folders above that one and print it

Sample usage:

* Open a terminal in vendor/candy/scripts, and run using this syntax:
    'python merge-aosp.py 10.0.0_r14'

* The script will remove local source and force sync so make sure any local changes are saved!

* The end result is a list of repos that need merge conflicts resolved

Have fun!
